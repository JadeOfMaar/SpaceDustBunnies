More resources for Nertea's [Space Dust](https://github.com/ChrisAdderley/SpaceDust) system. Inspired by [Rational Resources](https://github.com/JadeOfMaar/RationalResources) this mod adds resources relevant to certain popular mods or the subjects thereof: life support, Mars Direct, far future propulsion methods.  

Space Dust itself only overhauls atmo and exo harvesting, so crustal and surface harvesting are untouched.

This mod ensures the presence of the following resources:
* All that are used by Nertea's mods.
* Additional resources: LqdAmmonia, LqdCO2, LqdMethane, LqdNitrogen, Rock, Water.
